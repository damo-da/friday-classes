# Friday classes
Friday class tutorials will be published in this repo.

## Requirements
* Python 3.*
* `virtualenv` (install using `python -m pip install virtualenv`)

## Running a project
* Get into a directory (e.g. `cd chess`)
* If there isn't a `venv` directory, initialize the virtual environment directory using `virtualenv venv`
* Active the environment.
    * If windows, run `venv/bin/activate.bat` 
    * Otherwise, run `source venv/bin/activate`.
* If you're running the program for the first time, run:
    > `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    (It is always safe to run this line, as it simply installs the necessary packages that your package will need.)
* Run the program:
    * `python main.py`.
